## Classification Loss Functions

Measures the accuracy for predictions of a model, less the number means higher accuracy

### Binary Classification

1. Binary Cross Entropy Loss
   - Used for binary and multi-class classification problems
   - Predicts the probability for a single positive class
   - Compares the predicted probability with the true binary label for each example
     
2. Hinge Loss
   - Used for binary classification problems
   - Focuse on correctly classifying data
   - Apply penalty when the prediction is on the wrong side of the margin

### Multi-Class Classification - Single Label

1. Mean Squared Error Loss
   - Used when there are continuous value
   - Measure average square difference between the predicted values and the true labels
   - Sensitive to outliers
   
2. Mean Bias Error Loss
   - Used in regression tasks to measure the average bias in the predictions
   - Focus on the direction of the error
   - Bias is positive when over-predict, negative when under-predict

### Multi-Class Classification - Multi-Label

1. Multi-Class Cross Entropy Loss
   - Used when there are more than two classes.
   - Each example belongs to exactly one class.
   - Compares the predicted probability distribution with the true class label, penalizing incorrect or low-confidence predictions.
     
2. Binary Cross Entropy Loss

## Classify Images

Use multi-class cross entropy loss `ResNet18`

### Aims

- Develop an image classification system based on `00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb` from [lovellbrian/course22](https://github.com/lovellbrian/course22)
- Target classes for classification: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, and dog
- Use DuckDuckGo to scrape sample images
- Design or select an appropriate multiclass loss function

### Feedback

- GPU learning environment is based on Nvidia GPUs, which causes errors on devices with Apple silicon and Intel chips
- Format of downloaded images may cause errors
- Learning loop takes longer than expected when processing an increased number of images
- Although the accuracy shows above 0.9, there are still obvious classification errors
